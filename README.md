SenseiBot 🤖  
Hey there! Welcome to my Gemini powered AI Bot—a cool little project where I’ve tapped into the Gemini API to build a chatbot that’s kinda like having a convo with a super-smart friend. It’s fun, it’s chatty, and it’s here to answer your questions with a sprinkle of AI magic!

What’s This All About? ✨  
This bot is my playground for experimenting with the Gemini API. It listens to your input, thinks (well, sorta), and fires back responses that aim to be helpful or at least make you smile. Perfect for anyone curious about AI or just wanting to mess around with a chatbot.

Why I Built This👨‍💻  
I’m just someone who loves tinkering with code and AI. This project was my way of diving into the Gemini API and building something fun to share. Hope you enjoy playing with it as much as I enjoyed making it!
